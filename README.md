# Wardrobe Wizard: Oasis Club (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Welcome to Wardrobe Wizard: your solution for effortless outfit selection tailored to the day's weather!

Do you find yourself struggling to choose the right attire every morning, only to realize it's not suitable for the day's weather? Say goodbye to wardrobe woes with Wardrobe Wizard!

Simply create your account and start curating your wardrobe in the 'My Wardrobe' section. Once you've added your favorite pieces, head over to the 'Generate Outfit' page. Input your location and desired style, and voila! Wardrobe Wizard will conjure up the perfect outfit for you, taking into account both the weather and your preferred style for the day.

A big thank you to my partners Ahn, Khang, and Sophia, as well as our mentor Anish, for their contributions to this project. It was a great experience to work with others, so thank you to Oasis Northeastern coding club for setting up the groups and learning experiences.
